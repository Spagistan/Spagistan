# Spagistan
ARMA 3 Mod for the Spagistan Armed Forces unit.

Dependencies: RHSAFRF, RHSUSAF, RHSSAF, TFAR

Project structure modelled after RHS, mostly ~~because game modding is some cargo cult bullshit and I have no idea what I'm doing~~ because game modding is difficult and you should learn from the best :).

Mod should build and run so long as you have the dependencies from RHS and the base game set up in your project drive.

Currently consists of a handful of reskins and a custom faction (incomplete).
