Building The Spaggi Mod

Dependencies: RHSAFRF, RHSUSAF, RHSSAF
Project structure modelled after RHS, mostly because game modding is some cargo cult bullshit and I have no idea what I'm doing.

As of now, this is only the initial groundwork for the mod. Definitely will not run, and even the bits that are roughly complete probably have some typos or something that would keep them from working.
