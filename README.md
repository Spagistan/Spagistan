Building The Spaggi Mod

Dependencies: RHSAFRF, RHSUSAF, RHSSAF, TFAR

Project structure modelled after RHS, mostly ~~because game modding is some cargo cult bullshit and I have no idea what I'm doing~~ because game modding is difficult and you should learn from the best :).

As of now, this is only the initial groundwork for the mod. Definitely will not run, and even the bits that are roughly complete probably have some typos or something that would keep them from working.

## Todo:
Finish initial implementation.
Double-check texture files to make sure they conform to https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma:_Texture_Naming_Rules
